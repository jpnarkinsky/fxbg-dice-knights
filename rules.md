# Rules

These are rules to ensure we are a safe, inclusive place to play, both in person and online.
- Respect everyone. We are graciously being hosted by Barnes & Noble, who have a code of conduct that we will abide by. Discriminatory behavior towards others based on age, sex, race, color, ancestry, religion, creed, citizenship status, disability, national origin, marital status, military status, sexual orientation, or gender identity and expression will not be tolerated. Discriminatory language will not be tolerated. No harassment or abuse of other members will be tolerated. No aggressive or intentionally harmful behavior or language towards others will be tolerated.
- Keep conflicts outside of the game. Don’t bring personal conflicts to the table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. If you have a conflict at the table that you can’t handle in a respectful manner, then hold it until the game is over and consider asking a Dungeon Master to join the conversation. If there is a disagreement on things like in-game rules or outcomes, remember that you can plead your case but the Dungeon Master has the ultimate say on what happens in-game.
- Make yourself heard. The Dungeon Masters will do their best to foster an environment where everyone is comfortable, but they have many responsibilities and cannot address what they do not notice or might not be able to address something in the moment. If someone’s language or behavior makes you uncomfortable (even if it is not aimed at you), please communicate it to a Dungeon Master so that problems can be addressed quickly. As leaders in the group, please let them lead steps toward resolution of the issue and prevention of future issues.
- Respect content boundaries. We are playing in a public space, with people from a wide array of ages, backgrounds, and belief systems. Respect the boundaries of the players at your table- this includes things like gore and sexual content (as a default, nothing you wouldn’t see in a Marvel movie). Be willing to ask the table if certain topics or language is okay. If there are any topics beyond this that upset you, please reach out to a Dungeon Master to discuss them. 
- Three Strikes. This is a place where it’s okay to learn from mistakes. If a Dungeon Master has to address your behavior or language, understand that it is with the intention of making the table safe for everyone, not necessarily taking a side or condemning you. However, repeated bad behavior will not be tolerated, and can be grounds to be prohibited from joining future games. For behavior that is especially disruptive or harmful (generally the Serious Stuff), a Dungeon Master can issue a “strike.” A third strike means you will be prohibited from participating in the future. This will not apply if there is a potential for physical harm, where prohibitive and legal action can be taken immediately.
- Safety first. As a group, we wish to abstain from things that would create an unsafe or uncomfortable environment for our players. We ask that you do not bring real-life weapons or items that resemble real-life weapons to our events. As we hold our events in public spaces, we would ask that these items be left at home for the safety and comfort of all our players and those also using the public spaces we hold our events in. We kindly ask that you also watch your language and how you present yourselves (please remember that there are younger players at our tables). If you feel that something is obscene, you should give consideration as to how others might view it too. Think before you act. 

# Etiquette

These are some "soft" guidelines to help us play respectfully in a public space.

- Be Friendly: We are here to participate in cooperative gameplay, where everyone contributes.  Avoid talking over others, let everyone make their own decisions, encourage each other to participate in the story, and set each other up for success.
- Be Respectful: Be polite and ask first if you want to touch someone or their things. Let people make their boundaries clear regarding their possessions, and follow those boundaries.
- Be Patient: We have players of different experience levels, and sometimes have brand new players. Be patient and supportive of learning players- focus on what they can do, not what they should do.
- Be Aware:  We are doing our best with limited space. Please be respectful of the players at the table and do your best to limit how much space you take up. We are also in a public store, so please keep the noise level reasonably low.
- Be Cooperative: Unless you have spoken to the DM about it, characters should have general inclination toward heroism. Please avoid characters that are evil, self-isolating, or chaotic for its own sake- we only win when we win together.
- Be Helpful: There is only one Dungeon Master at the table. Providing game knowledge as a player can be helpful, but please avoid being controlling or overly disruptive. Remember that the Dungeon Master has ultimate say to what happens in-game, even if it involves bending or breaking the rules as written.
- Be Attentive: Side conversations and social media are fun, but we are here to enjoy games together with a limited amount of time. Pay attention, be ready when it’s your turn, prepare to be seated and engaged until the session is over, and don’t let distractions disrupt the table.
- Be Considerate: If you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Please be considerate of everyone’s health and safety, and take the time to rest and heal.
- Be Honest: We all roll ones from time to time. Don’t lie about rolls, change your character, or bend the rules in order to change the outcome- let the dice tell the story.
- Be Fair: Any homebrew content must be approved by the Dungeon Master before it can be used in-game. Homebrew content can be fun, but may not be right for the session the Dungeon Master is running.

# Guidelines for Substance Use at Dice Knights Gatherings

Context: This is more or less something we created specifically for public group gatherings with alcohol availability.

For members of the legal drinking age, the consumption of alcohol at our meetings is permitted if the venue allows it. However, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a respectful and safe environment for all attendees:

1. Compliance with Laws:
  Illegal activities, including underage drinking or illegal drug use, are strictly prohibited

2. Adherence to Venue Policies: 
  Respect the specific policies regarding substance use at the venues where we meet (e.g., Wegmans, Barnes & Noble, or any place where we decide to have a formal group meeting). Ensure that you are familiar with what is and isn't acceptable before partaking

3. Representation of Dice Knights: 
  Regardless of whether a Dice Knights gathering involves playing a ttrpg or just getting together to do something fun,  when in the group, your behavior reflects on Dice Knights as a whole. We expect all members to conduct themselves with respect and consideration
4. Disruptive Behavior:
  If any member becomes disruptive or belligerent due to substance use, they will be asked to leave the event

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Thank you for your cooperation.
